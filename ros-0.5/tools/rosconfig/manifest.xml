  <description brief="A configuration tool to set up ROS systems">
    The motivation for rosconfig is the kernel's "menuconfig" or "xconfig"
    tools, which set up a build environment for you. The idea is that you can
    use the rosconfig tool, combined with a YAML description of the system you
    want, and poof it sets it up for you -- which may entail SVN checkouts, 
    network-filesystem symlinks, etc. Importantly, rosconfig lets you have
    various parts of your system "frozen" so that you can set up a stable
    environment for various people working on various projects, even if you
    are depending on non-released code. Essentially, it lets you set up your
    own update schedule, rather than being forced to use other people's release
    and development schedule.
